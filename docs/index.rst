Welcome to django-tinymce4-lite documentation!
==============================================

**django-tinymce4-lite** is a reworked fork of `django-tinymce4`_. It provides a `TinyMCE 4`_
editor widget that can be used in Django forms and models.

  *TinyMCE 4 editor in Django Admin interface*

In this fork all legacy and broken code has been cleaned in order to provide simple
but full-featured TinyMCE 4 experience in Django projects.

**django-tinymce4-lite** can use `django-filebrowser-no-grappelli`_
as a file manager for TinyMCE 4 to insert images and file links into edited text.

.. note:: Currently ``django-filebrowser`` (grapelli-based) is not compatible
  with **django-tinymce4-lite** because it lacks support for TinyMCE 4. See this
  `pull request <https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-filebrowser/pull/255>`_
  for more details.

The application also includes a spellchecker service for TinyMCE 4 spellchecker
plugin.

Compatibility
-------------

- **Python**: 3.5+
- **Django**: 1.11+

.. note:: I try to keep **django-tinymce4-lite** up to date with current Python and Django versions,
  but third-party packages, like filebrowsers, may be incompatible with the latest Python/Django.
  It's up to those packages' authors/maintainers to keep their work in sync with recent developments.
